Task:3                                                    
1) create the sales.sales_summary table by using the following query:
SELECT
    b.brand_name AS brand,
    c.category_name AS category,
    p.model_year,
    round(
        SUM (
            quantity * i.list_price * (1 - discount)
        ),
        0
    ) sales INTO sales.sales_summary
FROM
    sales.order_items i
INNER JOIN production.products p ON p.product_id = i.product_id
INNER JOIN production.brands b ON b.brand_id = p.brand_id
INNER JOIN production.categories c ON c.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY
    b.brand_name,
    c.category_name,
    p.model_year
ORDER BY
    b.brand_name,
    c.category_name,
    p.model_year;
2)	CUBE:
Refer task 2a:
The CUBE is a subclause of the GROUP BY clause that allows you to generate multiple grouping sets. The following illustrates the general syntax of the CUBE:
SELECT
    d1,
    d2,
    d3,
    aggregate_function (c4)
FROM
    table_name
GROUP BY
    d1,
    CUBE (d2, d3);

Example:
SELECT
    brand,
    category,
    SUM (sales) sales
FROM
    sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY
    CUBE(brand, cate
SELECT
    d1,
    d2,
    d3,
    aggregate_function(c4)
FROM
    table_name
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP (d1, d2, d3);
Upload and configure the sample data warehouse (refer task2a)
Select the New Query, then new query tab will be opened.
ROLLUP Query
SELECT
    brand,
    category,
    SUM (sales) sales
FROM
    sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP(brand, category);

gory);
3)	ROLLUP
SELECT
    d1,
    d2,
    d3,
    aggregate_function(c4)
FROM
    table_name
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP (d1, d2, d3);
Upload and configure the sample data warehouse (refer task2a)
Select the New Query, then new query tab will be opened.
ROLLUP Query
SELECT
    brand,
    category,
    SUM (sales) sales
FROM
    sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP(brand, category);

4)	DRILLDOWN
SELECT
    brand,
    category,
    SUM (sales) sales
FROM
    sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP(brand, category)
HAVING SUM (sales) > 20000;

5)	SLICING:
SELECT
    *
FROM
    sales.customers
WHERE
    state = 'CA';

6)	DICING:
SELECT
    city,
    COUNT (*)
FROM
    sales.customers
WHERE
    state = 'CA'
GROUP BY
    city
HAVING
    COUNT (*) > 10
ORDER BY
    city;
7)	PIVOT
SELECT 
    category_name, 
    product_id
FROM 
    production.products p
    INNER JOIN production.categories c 
        ON c.category_id = p.category_id
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        category_name, 
        product_id
    FROM 
        production.products p
        INNER JOIN production.categories c 
            ON c.category_id = p.category_id
) t
SELECT * FROM   
(
    SELECT 
        category_name, 
        product_id
    FROM 
        production.products p
        INNER JOIN production.categories c 
            ON c.category_id = p.category_id
) t 
PIVOT(
    COUNT(product_id) 
    FOR category_name IN (
        [Children Bicycles], 
        [Comfort Bicycles], 
        [Cruisers Bicycles], 
        [Cyclocross Bicycles], 
        [Electric Bikes], 
        [Mountain Bikes], 
        [Road Bikes])
) AS pivot_table;
